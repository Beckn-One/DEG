As energy markets decentralize and the cost curve for DERs (solar panels, batteries, etc.) continues to fall, small-scale producers can join the formal energy ecosystem - but face a challenge of trust. Unlike large generators, whose fuel sources and production volumes are audited at scale, individual rooftop solar owners or community battery operators lack an equally cost-effective verification framework. Verifying that a seller of “green” kilowatt-hours is actually feeding solar energy into the grid - and ensuring that consumer subsidies (for example, EV-charging incentives) serve their intended purpose - requires faster, more efficient source authentication. 
Energy credentials provide a solution: digital attestations tied to each Energy Resource Address, conveying verifiable truths such as green-energy certification, maintenance logs, ownership status, subsidy eligibility (e.g., links to government DBT programs), and transactional history. 
Embedded in every intent, catalogue, and contract, these credentials make energy transactions both efficient and trustworthy.
