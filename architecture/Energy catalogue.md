An energy catalogue lists available resources, their quantities, locations, timings, pricing, constraints, obligations, and delivery methods. Examples include:
A utility offering anonymized data on consumption patterns.

- Availability of subsidies.
- Availability of a specified amount of solar energy during certain hours (e.g., 4 PM to 6 PM).
- Transmission service offerings.

These two components - intent and catalogue - act as complementary sides of a digital handshake. When an energy intent matches an energy catalogue offering, an energy contract is established. This cycle - intent matched with catalogue, forming a contract - is the fundamental interaction loop in the Digital Energy Grid (DEG).
