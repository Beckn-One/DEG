# General Workflow
The general workflow of an energy transaction consists of the following stages
1. Discovery of energy sources
2. Purchasing a specific units of energy
3. Transfer of energy
4. Providing Rating or Contacting Support
5. Reconciliation and Settlement
   
## Discovery
In this stage, the energy consumer looks for energy sources using various parameters. These energy sources could be energy generation companies, distribution companies, resellers, and even charging stations.

## Ordering
In this stage, the energy consumer places an order for the purchase of a specific amount of energy. This stage consists of three sub-interactions namely
1. Price Negotiation: In this interaction, the energy consumer fetches the quote at which the energy will be bought. The energy producer can provide promotional add-ons, discounts and offers with the quote. 
2. Terms Negotiation: In this interaction, the energy consumer provides their billing details and negotiate the terms of fulfillment with the producer.
3. Order confirmation: In this interaction, the energy consumer places the order and the energy producer confirms the order and initiates the fulfillment of the order. 

## Fulfillment
This is the stage where the energy transfer takes place. During the energy transfer, the following interactions can happen. 
1. Status updates : The energy producer can provide various fulfillment status updates. 
2. Tracking : The energy consumer can track the transfer of energy and other metrics in real-time,
3. Terms Updates : The energy consumer or producer can update the terms of the order
4. Cancellation : The energy consumer or producer can sometimes cancel the order. 

## Post-fulfillment
In this stage, the following interactions can happen
1. Rating: The energy consumer can rate the service provided by the energy producer. This may not be useful for plain energy contracts as the quality of energy does not diminish. However, the services involved in the transfer of energy can be rated on the bases of cost, speed, value-added services etc
2. Support: The energy consumer can fetch support information of the energy provider.

## Reconciliation and Settlement
Every contract involves payment, including energy. This stage can entered at any time during the transaction. In this stage, the energy consumer pays the energy provider as per the terms in the contract. This can be facilitated though various payment workflows. Depending on the nature of the energy contract, the payment could be,
1. On-demand as in the case of EV Charging,
2. Bulk settlement at the end of the month in the case of storage, or
3. Periodic payments as in the case of household electricity bill payments
and more.
