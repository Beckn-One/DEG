# Microgrid Aggregation Use Case Document

## Introduction
Microgrid aggregation is a critical use case in the energy sector where a Beckn Application Platform (BAP) searches for and connects with energy storage solutions (primarily batteries) to store excess energy produced by energy producers. This document outlines the comprehensive workflow, scope, and requirements for implementing microgrid aggregation using the DENT Protocol, which is an adaptation of the Beckn Protocol for the energy sector.

## Scope
The microgrid aggregation use case covers:

1. **Discovery of Energy Storage Solutions**: Finding available batteries or energy storage systems within a geographical area.
2. **Energy Storage Contracts**: Creating contracts for storing excess energy in available storage systems.
3. **Energy Retrieval**: Retrieving stored energy when needed.
4. **Monitoring and Management**: Real-time monitoring of energy storage levels and management of storage resources.
5. **Settlement and Reconciliation**: Payment and settlement for energy storage services.

Out of scope:
- Physical energy transfer infrastructure (hardware)
- Regulatory compliance verification
- Energy quality certification

## Use Case Flows

### 1. Discovery Flow
1. **Search Initiation**: BAP initiates a search for available energy storage solutions.
   - BAP sends a search request with location, capacity requirements, and time duration.
   - BPP (Beckn Provider Platform) responds with available storage options.

2. **Storage Provider Selection**: BAP selects a suitable storage provider.
   - BAP evaluates storage options based on capacity, cost, and availability.
   - BAP sends a select request to the chosen BPP.

### 2. Energy Storage Contract Flow
1. **Contract Initialization**: BAP initializes a storage contract.
   - BAP sends storage requirements (capacity, duration, etc.).
   - BPP responds with terms, conditions, and pricing.

2. **Contract Confirmation**: BAP confirms the storage contract.
   - BAP sends confirmation with payment details.
   - BPP confirms the contract and prepares the storage system.

### 3. Energy Transfer Flow
1. **Storage Initiation**: Energy producer begins transferring excess energy to storage.
   - BPP updates the status of energy transfer.
   - BAP monitors the transfer progress.

2. **Storage Completion**: Energy transfer is completed.
   - BPP sends confirmation of completed storage.
   - BAP receives storage receipt with details.

### 4. Energy Retrieval Flow
1. **Retrieval Request**: BAP requests energy retrieval.
   - BAP sends retrieval request with amount and time.
   - BPP confirms availability and prepares for retrieval.

2. **Retrieval Execution**: Energy is retrieved from storage.
   - BPP updates retrieval status.
   - BAP monitors retrieval progress.

### 5. Contract Termination Flow
1. **Contract Closure**: BAP requests to close the storage contract.
   - BAP sends contract termination request.
   - BPP confirms termination and processes final settlement.
